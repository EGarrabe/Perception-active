01.jpg,Coffee Cup,1,1,"Purple mug, category 1.",2.356,1," The image shows a robotic arm on a table with various items around it. There are two cups, one purple and one white, which could be personal items or electronics. A coffee cup is also present, which might belong in the personal items box (number 1). Additionally, there appears to be a small piece of paper or cardboard that could be considered trash and should go in the trash can (number 3). The robotic arm itself would likely be categorized as electronics (number 2) due to its mechanical nature. ",2.52,4,"The image features a **white robot arm** with a **black gripper** on its end. The robot arm is holding a **purple mug** that has a **white handle**. The mug is being lifted from a **white table**.

On the table, there are three objects: a **black square**, a **black rectangle**, and a **black circle**. These objects are located in front of the robot arm.

The background of the image is a **blue wall** with a white baseboard running along the bottom. The overall scene suggests an indoor setting, possibly a workspace or a factory floor where robotic arms are used for handling items.",7.649,1,"The object is a mug, which should go in the personal items / electronics box (number 1).",12.571,1,Mug. 1,17.29,1, The object appears to be a coffee mug with a purple design on it. It should go in the personal items / electronics box (number 1).,12.499,1,"Coffee mug, personal items box.",25.64
02.jpg,Soap,2,1,"Water bottle, category 1.",1.998,4," The image shows a robotic arm with a camera mounted on it. This setup appears to be part of a robotics project or demonstration. It's not clear if this is a personal item, an electronic component, or trash, as it seems to be a functional piece of equipment rather than something that would typically be discarded. ",1.672,1,"The object is a water bottle with a label that reads ""Nestle"". It should be placed in the personal items/electronics box.",1.233,2,"The object is a bottle of hand sanitizer, which should be placed in the cleaning box (number 2).",6.986,1,Water bottle. 1,2.674,1, The object appears to be a plastic water bottle with a label on it. It should go in the personal items/electronics box (number 1) as it is a commonly used item that might belong to someone working in the area or visiting.,2.338,2,The object appears to be a plastic bottle with a label on it. It should go in the cleaning box (number 2).,13.488
03.jpg,PCB,1,1,Circuit board - 1,1.951,1," The image shows a small electronic device with various components such as a microcontroller board, connectors, and possibly other integrated circuits or sensors. This object should go in the electronics box (number 1). ",1.215,1,"The image features a **red circuit board** with various components on it. The circuit board has **eight blue screws** and **two gold screws**, indicating different types of connections or attachments. There's also a **black battery** and a **gold capacitor** on the board, which are essential for storing energy and regulating voltage respectively.

The circuit board is placed on a **light brown wooden surface**, suggesting it might be in a workspace or a lab setting. The image does not contain any text or other objects, and there's no action taking place. It's a still life representation of an electronic component. 

Based on the content of the image, I would categorize this object as a **personal item/electronics box** (number 1). This is because circuit boards are commonly used in electronic devices, such as smartphones or laptops, which are personal items or electronics. The presence of screws and other components further supports this classification.",4.863,1,"The object is a circuit board, which should go in the personal items / electronics box (number 1).",6.939,1,Circuit board. 1,2.712,1," The object appears to be an electronic circuit board or printed circuit board (PCB). It has various components such as resistors, capacitors, and possibly integrated circuits or connectors. This type of object would typically go in the electronics box (number 1) for safe storage and organization.",2.536,1,The object appears to be a printed circuit board (PCB) with various electronic components mounted on it. It should go in the personal items / electronics box (number 1).,16.916
