SCRIPTS
--------------------------------------------

- main.py : test a list of prompts on a list of models on a list of models
	- prompts to use stored in ressources/all_prompts.txt
	- adds the model responses to output/responses.csv

- create_CSVs_from_responses.py : creates the following CSVs using output/responses.csv
	- a csv with the accuracy matrix (output/accuracy_matrix.csv) :
		- rows : prompts
		- columns : models
		- contents : the number of correctly guessed images for the corresponding prompt/model couple
	- for each image a csv with the accuracy matrix (output/image_matrices/) :
		- rows : prompts
		- columns : models
		- contents : true if the corresponding prompt/model couple guessed the correct object, false otherwise
	- for each model a csv with the accuracy matrix (output/model_matrices/) :
		- rows : prompts
		- columns : images
		- contents : true if the corresponding prompt/image couple guessed the correct object, false otherwise
	- for each prompt a csv with the accuracy matrix (output/prompt_matrices/) :
		- rows : models
		- columns : images
		- contents : true if the corresponding model/image couple guessed the correct object, false otherwise

- csv_to_image.py : transforms the outputted CSVs from create_CSVs_from_responses.py into PNGs for easier visualization.

- transform_images.py : used to create other variants of images like occluded, blurred, overexposure... TODO: not finished

- create_prompts_from_csv : used to generate a LOT of combinations of prompt based on parts of a prompt and what options each part has. UNUSED

IMPORTANT : if you want to reset everything you need to delete the contents of output/

RESULTS
--------------------------------------------
these are the results currently present in output/ at the time of writing this, I have tested the following 20 prompts :
- What is the object in the image? Answer with a single word.
- What is the object in the image? Ignore the robot arm, focus on the object, Answer with a single word.
- You are a robot. Based on what you see, you must identify the object. You will see a robotic arm in the image, but IGNORE IT, focus on the object. Be concise, identify the object.
- Based on what you see, you must identify the object. You will see a robotic arm in the image, but IGNORE IT, focus on the object. Be concise, identify the object.
- You must identify the object. You will see a robotic arm in the image, but IGNORE IT, focus on the object. Be concise, identify the object.
- Ignore the robotic arm. Focus only on the object being held. Identify it.
- You are analyzing this image to detect the item held. Disregard the arm or background clutter.
- Your task is to classify the item. Do not describe the robot or background.
- Identify the item in the image
- You are a warehouse robot sorting objects. What are you holding?
- Act as a robotic assistant that identifies tools. What is in your grip?

on all 60 images from ressources/images_base

These results are also stored in output_archives/output_20_prompts in case you delete them from output/ for testing the code/

There are also the results for just the best 7 prompts in output_archives/output_best_prompts

The file prompt_exploration.odt contains the analysis of the results, it is not finished yet
